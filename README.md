# Spec Development Protocol (SDP)

An AI-agentic framework for spec-driven engineering — structured, traceable, and ready for both greenfield and legacy projects.

SDP turns GitHub Copilot Agent Mode into a disciplined delivery team: a PRD author, analyst, architect, developer, reviewer, security auditor, and QA validator — all following a 6-gate SDLC process so nothing gets built without being properly specified first.

## Quick Install

Run this in the root of your project repository:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash
```

This copies the `.github/` framework files into your repository **without overwriting** any existing files. Your custom agents, instructions, and scripts stay untouched.

In this template repository, framework sources are stored under `src/`. During install, they are copied into your project's `.github/` folder.

**Options (via environment variables):**

| Variable        | Default           | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SDP_BRANCH`    | `main`            | Install from a specific branch or release tag                                 |
| `SDP_FORCE`     | `false`           | Set to `true` to overwrite existing SDP files during upgrade                  |
| `SDP_TECH_MODE` | `init`            | Control `.github/TECH.md`: `init` (create if missing), `overwrite`, or `skip` |
| `SDP_TARGET`    | current directory | Target repository root                                                        |

```bash
# Install a specific version
SDP_BRANCH=v1.0.0 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash

# Upgrade existing installation (overwrite SDP files)
SDP_FORCE=true curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash

# Upgrade SDP files but keep existing .github/TECH.md
SDP_FORCE=true SDP_TECH_MODE=skip curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash

# Re-initialize .github/TECH.md from template
SDP_TECH_MODE=overwrite curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WojcikMM/spec-development-protocol/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Create `.github/` in your project root if missing.
3. Copy the **contents of `src/`** into your project's `.github/` folder.
4. Existing files in your `.github/` folder should not be overwritten unless you explicitly choose to.

---

## Setup

### 1. Fill in `TECH.md`

After installation, open `.github/TECH.md` — this is the single source of truth SDP agents read before doing anything. Fill it in with your project's:

- Frontend and backend stack
- Infrastructure and cloud environment
- Coding standards and conventions
- Security and identity baseline

> **Working on an existing project?** Use `discover-tech` to trigger the `sdp.discover` agent, which reads your codebase and drafts `TECH.md` for review.

### 2. Enable Agent Mode in VS Code

SDP agents run in **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode**. Make sure you have the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension installed and agent mode enabled in your editor settings.

---

## How It Works

SDP enforces a **6-gate SDLC process**. Work progresses gate by gate — no coding until the design is approved, no design without a backlog, no backlog without a PRD.

```
Gate 1: Discovery      → PRD.md
Gate 2: Refinement     → BACKLOG.md + EPIC-*.md
Gate 3: Architecture   → Technical design docs
Gate 4: Planning       → Implementation plan (one story at a time)
Gate 5: Implementation → Code + tests
Gate 6: Hardening      → Review + Security audit + QA validation
```

### Starting a New Feature (Greenfield or Greenfield Feature)

Use the prompts in `.github/prompts/` to trigger the right agent at each gate:

| Step | Prompt file                     | What happens                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `create-prd`                    | Describe your idea — the PRD agent drafts `PRD.md` |
| 2    | `refine-backlog`                | Analyst breaks PRD into epics and user stories     |
| 3    | `design-system`                 | Architect produces a technical design              |
| 4    | `plan-task`                     | Developer plans one story (no code yet)            |
| 5    | `implement`                     | Developer implements the approved plan             |
| 6    | `run-review` + `audit-security` | Reviewer and Security agent validate the changes   |

### Working on a Legacy Project

SDP works equally well on existing codebases:

1. Fill `TECH.md` with your current stack (or generate a draft with the discovery agent).
2. Use `create-prd` to describe a specific change, bug fix, or improvement area.
3. Follow the gate sequence from there — the agents will respect your existing architecture and constraints.

## Agents

| Agent           | File                            | Purpose                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `sdp.prd`       | `agents/sdp.prd.agent.md`       | Writes `PRD.md` from business intent                |
| `sdp.discover`  | `agents/sdp.discover.agent.md`  | Discovers legacy stack signals and drafts `TECH.md` |
| `sdp.analyst`   | `agents/sdp.analyst.agent.md`   | Refines PRD into epics, features, and user stories  |
| `sdp.architect` | `agents/sdp.architect.agent.md` | Produces right-sized technical designs              |
| `sdp.developer` | `agents/sdp.developer.agent.md` | Plans and implements one story at a time            |
| `sdp.reviewer`  | `agents/sdp.reviewer.agent.md`  | Code and design review                              |
| `sdp.security`  | `agents/sdp.security.agent.md`  | Security audit (OWASP + cloud baselines)            |
| `sdp.qa`        | `agents/sdp.qa.agent.md`        | Validates acceptance criteria                       |

Agents hand off to each other automatically — after implementation the developer agent offers to trigger reviewer, security, and QA in one click.

## Prompts

Prompts are the entry points that activate agents with the correct mode:

| Prompt           | Triggers                         | Gate              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `discover-tech`  | `sdp.discover`                   | Legacy onboarding |
| `create-prd`     | `sdp.prd`                        | Gate 1            |
| `refine-backlog` | `sdp.analyst`                    | Gate 2            |
| `design-system`  | `sdp.architect`                  | Gate 3            |
| `plan-task`      | `sdp.developer` (plan mode)      | Gate 4            |
| `implement`      | `sdp.developer` (implement mode) | Gate 5            |
| `run-review`     | `sdp.reviewer`                   | Gate 6            |
| `audit-security` | `sdp.security`                   | Gate 6            |

## Customization

SDP is designed to coexist with your own tooling:

- **Custom agents:** add your own `.agent.md` files alongside the SDP ones — they won't be touched by updates.
- **Custom instructions:** extend `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with project-specific rules.
- **Custom prompts:** add prompts to `.github/prompts/` for team-specific workflows.
- **TECH.md is yours:** it's the one file you're expected to own and keep current.

---

## Templates

After installation, the `.github/templates/` folder in your project contains:

- `TECH.md` — blank TECH.md template to copy when starting a new project.
- `template.agent.md` — starter template for writing your own agents.
- `template.prompt.md` — starter template for writing your own prompts.
